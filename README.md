# humble-bundle-scraper

A bookmarklet to scrape [the HumbleBundle Keys page](https://www.humblebundle.com/home/keys) for your unredeemed keys that once done parsing will download that data as JSON. Note: The output will contain a URL specific to each key which you may not want to share. This is meant for personal use.

I've been a HumbleBundle supporter since it first started. As you might imagine, I've received a large number of game keys that I won't have the time for or I've already owned previously. Since the data isn't exportable from HumbleBundle, this is meant to get that data into an easy to use file so it can be modified and shared with friends so game keys can be given away.

## Todo List

- [ ] update tests to run as ES6
- [ ] consider JSON updates and other formats
